In modern computing environments, real-time monitoring of system
performance is critical for stability, security, and operational efficiency. This
project addresses the problem by integrating real-time system metric collection
with machine-learning based risk prediction. The system monitors CPU, RAM,
Disk, and Network usage, and classifies the system status as “High Risk” or
“Low Risk” using a trained machine learning model. The project includes a
web-based dashboard to visualize results and logs data into a MySQL database
for analysis.
Objective
1.Collect and analyze live system metrics (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network).
2.Train and evaluate multiple ML models: Neural Network, Random Forest,
SVM, XGBoost.
3.Integrate the best model into a Flask API.
4.Log predictions into MySQL database.
5.Display results on a responsive frontend.
