Introduction
In collaborative software development environments, maintaining clarity over task assignments, progress, and deadlines is essential. Tools like Jira and Trello provide robust solutions, but they often introduce complexities and overhead for smaller teams or custom workflows. This project replicates a simplified task-tracking environment through a full-stack web-based dashboard that allows users to add, view, edit, delete, and drag tasks between phases like “To Do”, “In Progress”, and “Done”. It is fully backed by a MySQL database and powered by PHP and JavaScript.
Objective
1.To create a lightweight and interactive task management system inspired by agile methodologies.
2.To enable drag-and-drop task movement between status columns.
3.To persist task data (including deadlines, assignment, and description) in a relational database.
4.To ensure responsiveness and intuitive use via dynamic JavaScript and clean styling.
